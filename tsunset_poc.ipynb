       "'CHAPTER: 1 introduction CONTENT:  cognitive scientists often note that neural networks can be organized to imple- ment logical operations and execute logical functions. some hypothesize that cognition is implemented directly by parallel processing algorithms that modify the connection weights within neural networks. others claim that cognition is a matter of implicit symbol manipulation that exploits inferential operations that are implemented by neural logic gates. each of these approaches has advanced our collective understanding of cognition and experience. but there is an approach to biological cognition that is less familiar and that highlights the diverse range of processes that are employed as animals navigate biological and social challenges to preserve viability. preserving viability often requires locating nutritional resources and remem- bering where they can be found, while avoiding predation and pursuing social support. these forms of cognition always unfold against the backdrop of metabolic demands that must be managed for an animal to survive and ﬂourish. in complex and dangerous environments, this will often require tracking the likelihood of various risks and threats; an animal’s sensitivity to these risks and threats will often be shaped by everything from the consequences of managing recent challenges to their histories of past trauma. just as importantly, the demands that arise in contexts like breeding, pregnancy, and lactation, as well as the management of hunger and thirst, can shift the features of the world that are most salient to an animal. so, a plausible story about cognition must explain how animals are able to respond to sustained patterns of resource availability, adjust their behavior in light of current and anticipated needs, and manage ﬂuctuations in bodily, ecological, and social variables. there is no doubt that such capacities are organized by nervous systems in all mobile animals. but a precise and general account of the biological processes that sustain adaptive behavior has proven elusive. there are observable regular- ities in neural processes that are modulated by various chemical systems. but adjustments to one process often evoke changes in other processes as animals respond to biological challenges, prioritize physiological and social needs, weigh opportunities, and establish efﬁcient trade-offs between diverse behav- ioral and cognitive strategies. consequently, a biological approach to cognition must move beyond simpliﬁed forms of functionalism that attempt to establish the neurally based causal relations that instantiate familiar categories like beliefs, desires, and thoughts in two ways: (1) it must provide a characterization of the ecological and physiological constraints that organize strategies for managing speciﬁc challenges and opportunities; and (2) it must highlight the embodied strategies that animals internalize as they learn to manage predictable 2 philosophy of mind and unpredictable changes in access to things like food, water, minerals, and social support. critically, this preserves a commitment to an empirically grounded form of functionalism, according to which the neural, chemical, and ecological phenomena that constitute animal minds are to be understood in terms of the causal roles that they play in guiding thought and behavior, as well as producing experiences of various challenges and opportunities. given these considerations, we will not defend an approach to cognition that is grounded in commonsense- or folk-psychology in this element. nor will we develop a priori claims about the nature of the mind. instead, we will pursue a naturalistic approach to biological cognition that preserves a tight connection to data and methods from the cognitive and biological sciences. in this respect, our approach diverges from recent defenses of philosophical empiricism that have garnered support from results in machine learning (buckner 2018). such approaches suggest that domain-general forms of learning and abstraction sufﬁce to explain all of the diverse capacities that are observed in cognitive systems. we disagree. but this is not because we accept a form of philosophical nativism that is anchored to traditional taxonomies of mental phenomena. we acknowledge that some cognitive capacities are resilient to differences in learning environments, and this is a point that we return to in the closing section of this element. furthermore, as we argue in section 3, there are cases where one-trial learning suggests that animals are biologically prepared to learn about speciﬁc domains of phenomena. but far more generally, we think that understanding biological cognition requires exploring the ways that ecological and physiological constraints shape the ﬂow of information through embodied, situated, and complex biological systems. at many points, we will thus appeal directly to physiological considerations. we hope that this will clarify the roles that evolution and development can play in shaping cognition, while leaving room for diverse cognitive strategies to arise as animals manage ecologically and socially signiﬁcant challenges. but to get a sense of what this means, it will help to consider the kinds of questions that arise when we focus on encouters with challenges and opportunities, in the context of preserving viability. in the remainder of this introductory section, we thus provide a high-level overview of the kind of cognitive architecture that supports biological cogni- tion. we then explore the implications of adopting this approach in the context of visual perception, a context where the importance of a biological perspective is likely to be clear to many philosophers and cognitive scientists (section 2). we then turn to questions about learning and social cognition (section 3 and section 4), and we conclude with a brief discussion of how this approach might shape future inquiries in the cognitive sciences (section 5). to ease into this approach, however, let’s begin by considering the behavior of free-roaming elephants (figure 1). biological cognition public domain image, elephant family in tanzania, wikimedia commons. figure 1 a small family of elephants.
