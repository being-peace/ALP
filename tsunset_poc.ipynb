       "'CHAPTER: 1.2 embodiment as a core principle of biological cognition CONTENT:  an inﬂuential understanding of this form of embodied pluralism was articulated by claude bernard. building on his knowledge of digestive enzymes, glucose synthesis, and the response of blood vessels to changes in temperature, he hypothesized that regulating the internal milieu was essential to life, and he argued that biological systems always have the purpose “of maintaining the integrity of the conditions for life in the internal environment” (bernard 1974, 89). bernard was not primarily concerned with mentality or cognition, but ivan pavlov (1927) extended the claim that biological systems preserve viability by regulating their internal milieu to questions about learning and decision- making, exploring the ways that animals adapt to contextual changes. he showed, for example, that interactions between the brain and digestive glands support a form of adaptive learning, where anticipating food passing through the oral cavity triggers insulin secretion, preparing the animal to absorb vital nutrients. this was a signiﬁcant advance because it showed that a cognitive state could use a chemical signal to organize system-level behavior, while the digestive glands could use that signal to shape experiences of hunger and satiation. pavlov hypothesized that extensions of this approach could provide a basis for a scientiﬁcally grounded theory of ‘psychic activity,’ including a wide range of psychiatric phenomena. 6 philosophy of mind drawing upon pavlov’s research, ernest starling (1905) examined a diverse range of chemical signals that could carry information through the bloodstream to organize nervous activity and regulate various organs. he called these chemical messengers ‘hormones’ (‘ὁρμάω,’ ‘setting in motion’), to highlight their role in exciting and arousing behavior. when his critical insights were taken up by walter cannon (1917, 1932), it became clear that there is a tight connection between the adrenal glands and the sympathetic nervous system. cannon spent much of his career showing that the secretion of adrenaline played an important role in adaptive responses to deviations away from biological set- points, or desired states of critical biological variables. for example, he pro- posed that the ‘ﬂight-or-ﬁght’ response is regulated by neuroendocrine systems that motivate actions that would restore homeostasis through the management of biological or social challenges. in the context of biological cognition, the management of biological and social challenges will always be complex. recall the elephants who must track and respond to numerous variables, ranging from the availability of nutritional resources to the stability of their social communities and the likelihood that speciﬁc humans pose a threat to their continued survival. these elephants must manage access to water and minerals, and they must determine when it makes sense to seek social support. in doing so they employ diverse anticipatory control systems, which are responsive to: (1) variations in internal variables; (2) variations in the social, ecological, and physiological factors that constrain behavior; and (3) variations in the interactions between these diverse constraints (bechtel 2009; schulkin 2011). a wide range of brain-based systems actively monitor physiologically signiﬁcant events; and they trigger anticipatory activity within diverse chemical signaling systems (including endocrine, neuroendo- crine, and neurotransmitter systems), which play multiple roles in the organiza- tion of behavior, the management of uncertainty, and the preservation of viability. over the past several decades, it has become increasingly clear that numerous interacting processes are coordinated as animals confront various challenges and opportunities. these processes depend upon chemical signals, which oper- ate over multiple timescales to organize behavior in response to changing needs for things like salt, glucose, water, and social acceptance; and they depend upon interactions between chemical and neural systems, which support the anticipa- tion of challenges and opportunities, as well as the compensatory strategies that must be employed to preserve viability (mcewen 2004, 2007; richter 1953; sapolsky 1996; schulkin 2004; schulkin & sterling 2019). research on these forms of physiological regulation have often focused on the forms of cognition that are employed in speciﬁc contexts, where speciﬁc biological cognition chemical and neural processes are employed to cope with speciﬁc regulatory demands. but it is difﬁcult to generalize from these precise and detailed explanations to the range of strategies that animals must employ as they accommodate shifting needs and priorities in naturalistic environments. this is a problem that commonly arises in biological contexts (levins 1966; odenbaugh 2003), but it will be crucial to keep this claim in mind over the course of this element: the internal complexity and inherent variability of biological systems make it difﬁcult to model behavior and physiological struc- ture in ways that are precise, general, and biologically realistic, and these difﬁculties are exacerbated where a diverse array of biological and social constraints shape cognition in an ongoing way.
